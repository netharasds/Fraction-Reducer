# Fraction-Reducer
This was an assignment in computer science class where we had different restrictions that will allow us to reduce fractions.  Special cases ● If the user enters a 0 for the denominator, the program should print: This fraction is undefined. ● If the user enters a 0 for the numerator (but a positive denominator), the program should just print 0 as the reduced fraction, something like 0/6 = 0. ● If the user gives a negative numerator or denominator, the program should say something like, Sorry, this program only handles non-negative numerators. ● If the fraction is already in reduced form (how could the program detect this?), then it should print something like, 7/9 is already in reduced form. ● If the fraction is reducible but the reduced fraction has a denominator of 1, then the 1 should not be printed. For example, if the user enters 21 and 7, the program should print 21/7 = 3 and not 21/7 = 3/1.
